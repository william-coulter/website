## Determinism

### Throwing a ball

Imagine you are throwing a tennis ball and you want to work out exactly where it will land. In order to achieve this, you need 3 pieces of information:

1.  The initial conditions.

"Initial conditions" being at the time the ball leaves your hand. This includes conditions like the ball's initial angle of trajectory, momentum and angular momentum. You might also want information on the environment such as the density of the air, the speed and direction of the wind and the force of gravity at that particular point on Earth. There are other initial conditions you might want depending on how accurate you want to be, but this is a good starting point.

2. Equations to model behaviour.

Once all of the initial conditions are retrieved, you need some way of modelling how the ball will behave in its environment. Mathematical equations are typically how people achieve this. You could use Newton's equations from his model of gravity, combined with Galileo's model of projectile motion and some equations for air resistance to predict the ball's behaviour with reasonable accuracy. Note that Einstein has since proved flaws in Newton's model of gravity (and today's physicists have since proved flaws in Einstein's model of gravity) but Newtonian equations were accurate enough to launch a space shuttle to the moon, so you conclude that they are good enough for your ball calculations.

3. Resources to calculate.

Now that you know all the information about the initial conditions of the ball and its environment, and you have the equations to accurately predict how the ball will move over time, all that's left is the resources for calculating where the ball will be at `t = x` seconds. For a projectile motion question like this, you could probably do all of this manually with a pen and some paper.

What if you wanted to calculate the motion of 10 different balls, each with their own initial conditions? Once again, you could probably achieve this manually with a pen, some paper and a cup of tea. Now let's say you're not calculating the motion of tennis balls, but fundamental quantum particles, and rather than calculating the position of 10 of them, you're calculating the position of 10 million. This would require resources such as a computer with the appropriate computing power and software.

### A calculatable universe?

If we can accurately predict the behaviour of a tennis ball at the time at which it has left your hand, can we do the same for the universe at the time that it began?

Let's look at our 3 requirements again.

1. The initial conditions.

We of course do not know the exact initial conditions of the universe, however assuming the universe does have a beginning, this is theoretically attainable.

2. Equations to model behaviour.

We have plenty of equations to model the behaviour of particles. Even though these are constantly being updated and it's very unlikely that the current equations are exact models of the behaviour of particles, this is also theoretically attainable.

3. Resources to calculate.

Computer processors are pretty good these days. Despite this, computers in 2021 are unable to process a model of a human brain on a cellular level, let alone the entire universe on a quantum particle level.

Even though the reaching the requirements for `1`, `2` and `3` is completely infeasible in 2021, this is because of our limited scientific knowledge and technology. Nothing about them is impossible, we're just not there yet. Surely it's reasonable to assume that we will one day satisfy these requirements and calculate the trajectory of the universe from start to finish.

So what does this mean? If the behaviour of the universe from beginning to the end can be calculated, is the universe just as deterministic as the tennis ball that you have thrown through the air?

The mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace theorised about a determistic universe. After Newtonian physics was grounded amongst the scientific community, Laplace said that if an intellect could know all the conditions of the universe at a point in time and put the data to analysis, then _"nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes"_.

<!-- STARTHERE -->

Except we don't observe a universe where nothing is uncertain. To understand this, we need to talk about information.

## The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics

The issue with this idea is that a unniverse in which nothing is uncertain would mean it carries no information. Let's talk about information for a bit.

### Schrodinger Equation

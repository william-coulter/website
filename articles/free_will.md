Determinism, the 2nd law of thermodynamics and why it's probably not free will.

## Determinism

### Throwing a ball

Imagine you are throwing a tennis ball and you want to work out exactly where it will land. In order to achieve this, you need 3 pieces of information:

1.  The initial conditions.

"Initial conditions" being at the time the ball leaves your hand. This includes conditions like the ball's initial angle of trajectory, momentum and angular momentum. You might also want information on the environment such as the density of the air, the speed and direction of the wind and the force of gravity at that particular point on Earth. There are other initial conditions you might want depending on how accurate you want to be, but this is a good starting point.

2. Equations to model behaviour.

Once all of the initial conditions are retrieved, you need some way of modelling how the ball will behave in its environment. Mathematical equations are typically how people achieve this. You could use Newton's equations from his model of gravity, combined with Galileo's model of projectile motion and some equations for air resistance to predict the ball's behaviour with reasonable accuracy. Note that Einstein has since proved flaws in Newton's model of gravity (and today's physicists have since proved flaws in Einstein's model of gravity) but Newtonian equations were accurate enough to launch a space shuttle to the moon, so you conclude that they are good enough for your ball calculations.

3. Resources to calculate.

Now that you know all the information about the initial conditions of the ball and its environment, and you have the equations to accurately predict how the ball will move over time, all that's left is the resources for calculating where the ball will be at `t = x` seconds. For a projectile motion question like this, you could probably do all of this manually with a pen and some paper.

What's fun to note is that if you know the conditions of the ball at one point in time, then you can derive its conditions at any point in time.

### A calculatable universe?

If we can accurately derive the trajectory of a tennis ball at any point in time, can we scale this calculation up and do the same for the entire universe?

Let's look at our 3 requirements again.

1. The initial conditions.

We of course do not know the exact initial conditions of the universe (or even the exact conditions of the universe right now), however assuming the universe does have a beginning, this is theoretically obtainable.

2. Equations to model behaviour.

We have plenty of equations to model the behaviour of particles. Even though these are constantly being updated and it's very unlikely that the current equations are exact models of the behaviour of particles, the equations are theoretically obtainable.

3. Resources to calculate.

Computers in 2021 are unable to process a model of a human brain on a cellular level, let alone the entire universe on a quantum particle level. There are however constant innovations being made on the computer processor so who knows how far off this is.

Even though the reaching the requirements for `1`, `2` and `3` is completely infeasible in 2021, it is not impossible; we're just not there _yet_. But just because it can't be done now, doesn't mean it can't be done ever. So is the universe just as deterministic as the tennis ball that you have thrown through the air?

There are some bleak consequences that arrise from a deterministic universe. Can the position of every particle in the universe at every point in time, future and past, be known? Is free will an illusion that can only manifest from our ignorance? Could someone have told me from <!-- TODO -->

The mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace theorised about a determistic universe. After Newtonian physics was grounded amongst the scientific community, Laplace said that if an intellect could know all the conditions of the universe at a point in time and put the data to analysis, then _"nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes"_.

Except we don't observe a universe where nothing is uncertain. There are some systems where knowing every single initial condition doesn't allow you to know the outcomes at every single point in time. To understand this, we need to talk about the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics.

## The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics

The 2nd law of thermodynamics states that any isolated system will trend towards maximum _entropy_.

### Entropy and Disorder and Information and Randomness

What is entropy? Entropy can be thought of as the amount of _disorder_ in a system. When you pour your milk into your English breakfast tea, it starts in a very ordered state with all the milk and tea molecules grouped separately. Over time, even without stirring, your tea will become disordered as the milk and tea molecules mix together until it is all a homogenous milk and tea solution.

In mathematics, entropy and information are fundamentally the same. The amount of information contained in a string of digits can be thought of how much entropy, or how much disorder, it contains. The string `010101010101010101` doesn't contain as much information as `001110010101011001` since the second string is more disordered. This makes intuitive sense as well since the first string contains repeated patterns which could probably be compressed into a smaller string. For example, we could represent the first string as `019` where `01` is the pattern and `9` is the amount of times it is repeated. The same compression would not be as effective in the second string since the occurance of its digits don't follow an obvious pattern; it's essentially _random_.

This was a quick explanation of the link between entropy and randomness. If you would like a more depth explanation, Veritasium has an excellent video of [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE).

So entropy is essentially the amount of randomness in a system. A fixed amount of entropy implies a fixed amount of randomness meaning a predictable pattern will emerge over time.

### A non-calculatable universe

Let's look back at what Laplace thought about an intelligence that learns the entire state of the unvierse: _"nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes"_.

If the universe is entirely calculatable and nothing is uncertain, then a pattern has emerged in the universe that can be used to deduce its entire trajectory, future and past. In other words, the amount of entropy in the universe would be a fixed amount and _constant_. But this is not the universe we observe! This is in direct contradiction to the 2nd law of thermodynamics which entails an increasing amount of entropy and randomness and uncertainty. So Laplace's envisioned intelligence cannot exist.

Phew, what a relief! If you are someone who doesn't want to live in a totally predictable and certain universe, you have the 2nd law of thermodynamics to thank.

So where is this information coming from?

### Quantum Physics

The answer to where the universe's ever increasing entropy comes from is not known however, under our current understanding of the universe, a good place to look might be quantum physics.

As I mentioned previously, there are some systems in the universe in which every single initial condition doesn't allow you to know the outcomes at every single point in time. Knowing the initial conditions of a fundamental quantum particle, say an electron, does not let you predict _exactly_ where the electron will be at `t = x` seconds in the same way that you can for tennis ball, but you can predict _probably_ where it's going to be.

The Schrodinger Equation is used in quantum physics to derive a _probability density function_ from a particle's initial conditions. As opposed to in classical physics where a function will tell you where an object will be at any point in time, the probability density function will tell you the probabilty that a particle will be in a certain location at any point in time. It is not until a measurement is taken that the particle's properties become known, however a calculation and prediction on the future value of these properties is entirely probabilistic. It is uncertain beforehand; it is random (within constraints).

Every time quantum particles interact, the universe gains a small amount of entropy. Randomness is baked into our universe.

## Why it's probably not free will

### Negative

<!-- This article was largely inspired by the aforementioned Veritasium video (linked ). At the end of the video, Muller states that _"our free will could come from the quantum events in our brains"_.

I absolutely love Muller's channel and this video is one of the few videos on YouTube that I have clicked the "like" button for, but I thought this closing statement was absolutely proposterous! -->

Some people (inlcuding Muller in [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMb00lz-IfE) which this article was largely inspired from) hypothesise that human free will could come from the quantum events in our brains.

I think that this could be the case, but it's like <!-- TODO -->

To clarify, I am not saying that this statement is wrong. It is entirely possible that human free will exists and its source is in our 2021 understanding of quantum physics. This could be true and nobody knows the answer to those questions. But I am saying that the probability of this being true is so minute that it's not worth considering.

<!-- STARTHERE -->

Think about how brief humans are in the timeline of the universe. Humans have existed for approximately 0.0000145% of the universe's lifetime.

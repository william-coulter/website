## Throwing a ball

Imagine you are throwing a ball and you want to work out exactly where it will land. In order to achieve this, you need 3 pieces of information:

1.  The initial conditions.

"Initial conditions" being at the time the ball leaves your hand. This includes conditions like the ball's initial angle of trajectory, momentum and angular momentum. You might also want information on the environment such as the density of the air, the speed and direction of the wind and the force of gravity at that particular point on Earth. There are other initial conditions you might want depending on how accurate you want to be, but this is a good starting point.

2. Equations to model behaviour.

Once all of the initial conditions are retrieved, you need some way of modelling how the ball will behave in its environment. Mathematical equations are typically how people achieve this. You could use Newton's equations from his model of gravity, combined with Galileo's model of projectile motion and some equations for air resistance to predict the ball's behaviour with reasonable accuracy. Note that Einstein has since proved flaws in Newton's model of gravity (and today's physicists have since proved flaws in Einstein's model of gravity) but Newtonian equations were accurate enough to launch a space shuttle to the moon, so you conclude that they are good enough for your ball calculations.

3. Resources to calculate.

Time / energy.

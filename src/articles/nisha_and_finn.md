# How I met Nisha and Finn

In July 2022, I planned a trip to Melbourne. Shippit has an an office in Melbourne so it was easy to take time during the week to work and have a bit of a holiday.

I booked an AirBnB in Southbank for only $70 a night which was incredibly cheap. The place didn't look incredibly fancy from the photos but the location was good and I wasn't going to be hanging around the place anyway.

I was telling one of my friends about it and he asked if I was staying in an apartment or just a private room. I had no idea what he meant. Aren't all AirBnBs just an empty place? It turns out I had booked a private room in an apartment that I would share with the owner. That's how I met Nisha and Finn.

# The first thing you notice about Nisha

Nisha absolutely _loves_ Finn. As soon as I arrived, Nisha dove into conversation about how she and Finn first met and how long they've been living together (14 years).

Nisha told me about the bets that they place on the AFL and how over the 14 years they've been together Finn has ended up on top. They used to live in Sydney but when they moved to Melbourne they had to switch AFL teams. Nisha told me about how difficult the discussion was and eventually they decided to support the Geelong Cats.

# The first thing you notice about Finn

Finn is a cat. Yeah, I was a bit of a wanker for obfuscating that fact earlier.

As Nisha was divulging her stories about her and Finn as if he was another human and capable of understanding the concept of betting, I couldn't help but think how delusional the situation was. Despite this, I still absolutely adore Nisha and Finn's relationship.

Although Finn probably doesn't understand any of the conversations Nisha is having with him, it feels incredibly genuine.

# Finn is old

The first question I asked about Finn is whether he was an old cat. Nisha explained that he was and asked me why I thought so.

Finn has one of those boney cat spines that feels brittle to touch. On top of this, he was incredibly skinny (in spite of the tremendous amount of snacking Nisha indulges him in).

Nisha seemed concerned that I had noticed his age because she also had noticed his bonyness. She asked me if I knew why old cats get like this. I didn't, but I told Nisha I will ask my cousin who is a vet.

# The prognosis

Suzie said that not all cats get super skinny but they commonly develop hyperthyroidism or chronic kidney failure. This causes cats to not be able to maintain weight but can be easily mitigated with correct treatment. Despite this, this is generally an indicator that a cat is reaching the end of its lifetime.

I didn't explain that last part to Nisha. I hope Finn couldn't tell that I was omitting information. My reasoning was that Nisha seems like a fretter and is taking Finn to the vet in a week anyway so there's no point in stressing her out before the appointment.

<!-- # Ethics

This got me thinking about the ethics of my white lie.

My personal values are to prioritise the truth over everything else. It doesn't matter how difficult the truth is to process, it's better than not having all the information. _"If The Matrix was real, then I would take the red pill"_ I tell myself.

But how can I believe that I value truth, yet also justify my decision to lie to Nisha?

Was it because I believe that Nisha couldn't handle the truth and therefore wasn't worthy to hear it? What right do I have to decide who and who shouldn't hear the truth? Maybe I thought that

It's interesting how we hold our values to differn -->

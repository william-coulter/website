# The Better Team

What's a more impressive scoreline for a team, 15-0 or 42-8?

## Background

In April 2022, the E-Sports League of Legends Team T1 had an "undefeated" split where they won [18 series in a row](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/LCK/2022_Season/Spring_Season) to be crowned the League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK) Sprint Split 2022 champions. I say _undefeated_ in quotation marks because while T1 was undefeated in series, a series is played as a best-of-three meaning T1 can lose _games_ but still win the _series_. And in fact they did lose games. T1's game record at the end of their undefeated series season was 42 wins and 8 losses.
 
T1's 2022 performance was met with a lot of praise and analysts believed they were the best team in the world at that time. Some people however, liked to tunnel on the fact that T1 had a literal undefeated split back in 2014.

This is a quote from Phreak on the JLXP podcast:

<!-- TODO: reference the exact podcast -->

> I just want to stipulate that they had an _actual_ undefeated season.

> They are undefeated in matches, that is true. It is an undefeated season through that lens I just... You know, "historic undefeated season", they had an actual lossless season is all im kind of saying; there's a different version of this that is even more impressive. 

> They did something that I would argue is more impressive before.
> Let's say your chance to win every game is 90 / 10, you don't go 15-0. If your chance to win every game is 85%, this (meaning the 42-8 record) is your scoreline.

> Their level of domination was even higher, to me.

In 2014, T1 (branded as SKT) participated in the [Champions 2014 Winter](https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Champions/2014_Season/Winter_Season) and won 15 _games_ to win the tournament. 

Phreak raises a good point. T1 did actually have an undefeated season back in 2014. The question is, is this more impressive than their 42-8 record from 2022? 

I would argue: maybe.

## Probability

When Phreak says _"let's say your chance to win every game is 90 / 10, you don't go 15-0"_ this is actually incorrect.
